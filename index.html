			<p><span class="firstCap">N</span>ew York State Senator Zellnor Myrie added his name to the 2025 race for mayor of New York City on May 8, 2024. He faces the embattled incumbent Eric Adams along with ten other candidates. With six years in the state senate under his belt, Myrie brings considerable legislative experience to his candidacy. Here's a breakdown.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Gun Control Laws</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="firstCap">M</span>yrie held a press conference this September, steps away from the site of a mass shooting that occured at the West Indian Day Parade in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.</p>
			
			<p>Although hundreds of police monitored the parade, they couldn't prevent a gunman from shooting five and killing one. In response, Myrie announced two bills that aim to quicken money into communities affected by gun violence. It wasn't the first time he addressed the issue with policy. In the last year, he voted yes to: <ul>
			<li>Limit the marketing and usage of firearms.</li>
			<li>Establish a ten day waiting period for the purchase of a firearm.</li>
			<li>Establish educational programs regarding safe storage of firearms.</li>
			<li>Establish rules on firearm training and dealer written warnings</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>Criminal Justice</h2>
			<p><span class="firstCap">M</span>yrie favors reasonable measures to help people behind bars. Last year he voted yes to: 
			<ul>
			<li>Support the rights and care of pregnant and postpartum people who are incarcerated.</li>
			<li>Establish a streamlined system for individuals to overturn certain wrongful convictions.</li>
			<li>Require automatic sealing of certain convictions records after specified periods of time.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
			<h2>Women's Rights</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="firstCap">M</span>yrie has voted on certain measures to ensure women's rights while in the state senate.  He voted yes to:
			<ul>
			<li>Prohibit the intoxication of the victim as a defense in sex crimes.</li>	
			<li>A bill that amends the state penal code to expand the definition of rape.</li>
			<li>Amend policies for model management companies and define unacceptable and acceptable standards of business for model representation in New York.</li>
			<li>Amend the Family Court Act and the New York City Council Act by increasing the amount of judges in certain courts.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="firstCap">T</span>he senator has voted yes on a number of measures to improve New Yorker's health and safety. Among these, Myrie has voted yes to:
			<ul>
			<li>Ensure families have six weeks of paid leave after suffering a stillbirth.</li>	
			<li>Require seat belts be available and used on charter buses for minors aged eight to sixteen.</li>
			<li>Prohibit the removal of children from homes as a response to the child receiving gender-affirming care in New York.</li>
			<li> Expand health insurance coverage for breast imaging in New York.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
<br>
		<h2>Disapproval of Adams</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="firstCap">M</span>yrie openly disapproves of Mayor Eric Adams. Among the first to challenge the mayor in a primary, Myrie's focus has been on policy over policing. He tweeted on Adams's shortcomings and inability to lead while under the spotlight of an indictment.
